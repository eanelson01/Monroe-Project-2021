# Monroe Research Project: Using a convolutional neural network and satelite imagery to predict population in Harrisonburg, Va
### Abstract
The main objective of my research project this summer is to predict population in Harrisonburg using satelite imagery. This information will allow counties in Harrisonburg to confidently predict where people are most congregated. The idea of this project came from multiple changes in the Rockingham County school district boundries as administraters tried to accomadate for changing population counts in each area. This resulted in fluctuations in student body numbers, the creation of new schools, and the movement of students based on their place of residence. With this model, school districts will be able to have up to date estimates on where students live, being able to better predict changes in student location to anticipate potential chagnes in the student enrollment numbers. 

My first sub-objective for this project is to undergo a thourough literature review of current techniques in population prediction using machine learning techniques. I will analyze published papers on the topic from 2019 until know, taking note of the machine learning techniques, satelite imagery sources, and methods they use to meet their goal. With this information I will better understand the direction I should take in my own pursuit.

My scond sub-objective 

For my third sub-objective, I want to properaly create, test, and asess a variety of CNN methods to understand which is best at classifying land structures and predicting population densities. I will test multiple CNNs so as to ensure that the one I know which most fits my objective. I will gather satelite imagery of Harrisonburg, Virginia and split it into training and testing data. With this technique, I will be able to confirm that the CNN is not over fit and has accurate predictions for data it has not yet see. Together, this process create an effective model for classifying urban structures as well as predictng population densities. 

With these steps I feel confident that I will be able to create a model capable of predicting population densities which will aid Harrisonburg County as well as the schools in the surronding areas.
