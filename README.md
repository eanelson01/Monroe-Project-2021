## Abstract
The main objective of my research project this summer is to predict the population in Harrisonburg using satellite imagery. This information will allow counties in Harrisonburg to confidently predict where people are most congregated. The idea of this project came from multiple changes in the Rockingham County school district boundaries as administrators tried to accommodate for changing population counts in each area. This resulted in fluctuations in student body numbers, the creation of new schools, and the movement of students based on their place of residence. With this model, school districts will be able to have up to date estimates on where students live, being able to better predict changes in student location to anticipate potential changes in the student enrollment numbers. 


### First Objective: Literature Review
My first objective for this project is to undergo a thorough literature review of current techniques in population prediction using machine learning techniques. I will analyze published papers on the topic from 2019 until now, taking note of the machine learning techniques, satellite imagery sources, and methods they use to meet their goal. With this information I will better understand the direction I should take in my own pursuit.

**Expected Time: 6/21-7/4**

### Second Objective: Data Collection
My second objective is to find the best sources of data that I need and to take steps to clean the data if necessary. I will mostly base this search for data sources off of the methods I read about in the literature review, basing my search on their suggestions. I will test the different satellite imagery I find to see which best fits my objective. As well, I will gather the necessary census data for the population predictions. 

**Expected Time: 7/5-7/11**

### Third Objective: Create and Test CNN
For my third objective, I want to properly create, test, and assess a variety of CNN methods to understand which is best at classifying land structures and predicting population densities. I will test multiple CNNs so as to ensure that the one I know which most fits my objective. I will gather satellite imagery of Harrisonburg, Virginia and split it into training and testing data. With this technique, I will be able to confirm that the CNN is not over fit and has accurate predictions for data it has not yet seen. Together, this process creates an effective model for classifying urban structures as well as predicting population densities. 

**Expected Time: 7/12-8/1**

With these steps I feel confident that I will be able to create a model capable of predicting population densities which will aid Harrisonburg County as well as the schools in the surrounding areas.
