# Proposed Calander for Monroe Summer Project
| Week  | Task |
| ------- | ------- |
| 6.21-6.27 | Continue working on my literature review, trying to focus on the methods use as I craft an understanding of what I will use going forward. |
| 6.28-7.4 | Finish up the literature review. Looking to have somewhere around 8-10 sources to have a solid understanding. Start to look at gathering satelite images and any additional data needed for analysis. |
| 7.5-7.11 | Continue gathering data and start process of coding using Tensor Flow inside PyCharm. I am not aware of how long this step will take and I will need to get a better frame of reference as the summer goes on. |
| 7.12-7.18 | Continue the process of testing different machine learning techniques in Tensor Flow and PyCharm. FInd out how to implement those methods using videos as guides|
| 7.19-7.25 | Using the selected model, use training data to train the model and begin to analyse the results. |
| 7.26-8.1 | Apply the model to Harrisonburh and begin a qualitative analysis of the results: what does it mean and how is the model helpful? Assess any flaws and begin to correct them. |
| 8.2-8.8 | Take results and compile them into a medium which is appropriate for sharing the results. Look into how I would like to present them and maybe look at how to publish. |
| 8.9-8.25 | Additional time which can be filled if I run behind schedule |
