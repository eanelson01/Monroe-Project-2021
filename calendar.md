# Proposed Calander for Monroe Summer Project

| Week  | Task |
| ----- | -----|
| 6/21-6/27 | I will work on my literature review, focusing on the methods used as I develop an understanding of what I can use going forward. |
| 6/28-7/4 | I'll start to finish up the literature review. I am looking to have somewhere around 8-10 sources in order to have a solid understanding. I'll start to look at gathering satellite images and any additional data needed for analysis. |
| 7/5-7/11 | I'll continue gathering data and start the process of coding using Tensor Flow inside PyCharm.|
| 7/12-7/18 | I'll continue the process of testing different machine learning techniques in Tensor Flow and PyCharm. I'll find out how to implement those methods using videos as guides in the process.|
| 7/19-7/25 | Using the selected model, I'll use training data to create the model and begin to analyse the results. |
| 7/26-8/1 | I'll apply the model to Harrisonburg and begin a qualitative analysis of the results: what do the results mean and how is the model helpful? I'll assess any flaws and begin to correct them for improvement. |
| 8/2-8/8 | I'll take results and compile them on this website to share my progress.|
| 8/9-8/25 | This will serve as additional time which I can take if I run behind schedule. |
