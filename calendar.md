# Proposed Calander for Monroe Summer Project
| Week | Task |
| :-- | --:|
| 6.21-6.27 | Continue working on my literature review, trying to focus on the methods use as I craft an understanding of what I will use going forward.|
| 6.28-7.4| Finish up the literature review. Looking to have somewhere around 10-15 sources to have a solid understanding. Start to look at gathering satelite images and any additional data needed for analysis.|
|7.5-7.11| Continue gathering data and start process of coding using Tensor Flow inside PyCharm. I am not aware of how long this step will take and I will need to get a better frame of reference as the summer goes on.|
|7.12-7.18| Continue the process of testing different machine learning techniques in Tensor Flow and PyCharm. Start to get numbers about effectiveness and being to pick the model which I want to use going forward.|
|7.19-7.25| Using the selected model, use training data of Harrisonburg and begin to analyse the results. |
|7.26-8.1| Begin a qualitative analysis of the results: what does it mean and how is the model helpful? Assess any flaws and begin to correct them.|
|8.2-8.8| Take results and compile them into a medium which is appropriate for sharing the results. Look into how I would like to present them and maybe look at how to publish.|
|8.9-8.25| Additional time which can be filled if I run behind schedule. It is a comfortable buffer zone that allows for any potential setbacks.|
