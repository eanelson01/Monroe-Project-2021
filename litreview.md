## Literature Review: An overview of the literature and its impact on my research project

1. [U-Net-Id, an Instance Segmentation Model
   for Building Extraction from Satellite
   Images—Case Study in the Joanópolis City, Brazil](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/10/1544)
    - This was the first article I read using the U-Net architecture for building segmentation. The authors of the study were able to segment buildings, tracking 3 different masks: building, border, and inner segment. The authors defined the border mask as the border of the building so that there were 4 pixels outside and 3 inside. They defined the inner segment as 2 pixels less than the building segment. The combination of these three masks made clearly defined building segments. This method was best for deleiniating between closer buildings because of its ability to find these distinct masks. For the training data the authors had to manually segment the 3 masks for each building. This manual process was one major drawback of the method and the main reason for me choosing a different method. The benefit of the paper was its use of a U-Net architecture. Reading the article made me more familiar with the Convolutional Neural Network technique and more aware of the possibilities with the architecture.
2. [Semantic Segmentation-Based Building Footprint
   Extraction Using Very High-Resolution Satellite
   Images and Multi-Source GIS Data](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/11/4/403)
   - This paper also uses a U-Net Architecture. The authors used the DeepGlobe Satellite Challenge dataset from 2018. This was a challenge dataset created to see who could come up with the best machine learning method for building segmentation. The dataset provides a great oppurtunity as it has the ground truth images, meaning there is no need for manual classification. Furthermore, the authors of the study did not delineate separate masks, but rather just whether the object was a building or not. To get further training data, the authors applied a series of processes to the images before putting it through the model. This included rotations of the image, changes in colors, changes in gamma, slicing, rescaling, and blurring the image. This made it so that the images were distinct but conveyed the same information, providing more to train on. The main author of the paper, Weijia Li, provided the skeleton [script](https://github.com/liweijia/Satellite-Segmentation) for the U-Net architecture. This makes their method easily replicable, and is one of the main reasons I chose their method to continue with my research project. The method and datasets provided by this paper laid out the best opportunities moving forward in this project.
